# About

This project is about aggregating your crypto portfolios from various sources,
like different exchanges, different blockchain wallets and manual asset
insertions. The project is written as a backend server so that in the future it
can easily have multiple frontends, like a web app, desktop app or whatever else
you would like to use.

# Security

This project is meant strictly for personal use, and is not meant as a SaaS,
only as a server that is going to be run locally and that is going to be
targeted with a local frontend.

# How to use

You will start up the server, but before doing that you will provide it with
configuration (where to find your portfolios), start up a local frontend which
targets this server, and that is about it, you will be able to see your
portfolio.
